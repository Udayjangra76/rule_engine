Rule Engine Application
This project is a Rule Engine Application that allows users to create, evaluate, update, and delete business rules. The rules are stored in a PostgreSQL database and can be evaluated against input data to produce results.

Features
Create Rule: Define and store rules using logical and comparison operators.
Evaluate Rules: Evaluate stored rules against input data to check their validity.
Update Rule: Modify existing rules in the database.
Delete Rule: Remove rules from the database.


Technologies Used
Backend: Flask (Python)
Database: PostgreSQL
Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
Other Libraries: SQLAlchemy, JSON
